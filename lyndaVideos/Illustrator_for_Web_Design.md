	Videos Watched on Lynda.com - Illustrator For Web Design

Watch following videos on 2/17/2013:

	Introduction  
	Core Concepts  
	Working with Color  
	  
	What I learned during these videos was how Illustrator works, its
	layout, what it can offer, and how pixels play a big role once images
	are converted for web viewing.  Illustrator offers great accuracy for
	creating web and mobile documents and allows users to save sized images
	as templates for future use.  In addition, working with colors helped
	me understand how to quickly gather colors that will be used often.

Watched following videos on 2/17/2013:

	Working with layers  
	Working with shapes and symbols  
	Creating Wireframes  
	Working with text  
	  
	What I learned from the videos is how to efficiently manage images
	using layers, speeding up my workflow by using symbols, and creating
	wireframes either using guidelines or the 960 gridsystem. The video on
	creating wireframes was something we went over in class but using the
	960 gridsystem offers a new process for those wanting to create a quick
	mockup.  Working with text is the most important video so far because I
	feel it really seperates web pages from others and by using Illustrator
	features like paragraph and character styles you are essentially
	creating the CSS that will be used on the actual HTML file.
	Illustrator really provides the start-up of a page design because it
	offers many features like gridlines, paragraph styles, or symbola which
	can be easily translated into actual code.  

Watch the following videos on 2/19/2013:

	Using Live Effects  
	Creating a Web Site Mockup  
	Creating UI Elements  
	  
	What I learned from the videos is how to preview effects on the current
	object being edited, how to create an actual mockup with navigation buttons
	and all the other good stuff, and working with User Interface elements.  The
	most important chapter had to be ch8 because it showed how the actual
	webpage would look like through a mockup.  It demonstrated the steps and
	elements that are put on the page.  Also creating butons was something I
	looked forward to learning because I feel they are an important part of the
	mockup.  I feel it seperates a cheap mockup from a good mockup.

Watched the following videos on 2/21/2013:

	Optimizing Web Graphics  
	Creating Image Sprites  
	Integrating with Other Apps  
	Conclusion

	What I learned from thie is how to slice up in Illustrator, differentiating web file formats,
	which formats are suitable for different images, the use of image sprites, and working with
	AI files in other Adobe programs and vice versa.  The most important topic about these videos
	was learning/seeing how to slice up images and then exporting them to HTML.  This is very
	important because ultimately getting the HTML code from Illustrator will make the coding
	process very easy.  The image sprites were kind of confusing even after researching some
	information about them but I understood the idea of what they could do.  What I look forward
	to is working with SVG graphics which seem very fascinating in their scalability and image
	size aspect.
