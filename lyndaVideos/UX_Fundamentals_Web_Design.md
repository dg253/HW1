Finished watching all of them on Feb 8,2013

What I learned from these series of videos is how a website has its purpose or
audience that needs to be targeted.  Its not only about getting content into
the website but planning a website that will allow users to find the
information they are looking for.  In addition, each section of a website has
its appropiate location; for example a header wouldnt be placed at the bottom
of the page but instead should be found above the fold.  These videos set a
good understanding for those to are new to website development but for those
with previous website development like me it reminds us that a website isnt
just about getting content into a page but correctly identifying our audience
and placing everything in its correct place.
